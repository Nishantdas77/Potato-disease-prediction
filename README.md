# ðŸ¥” Potato Disease Prediction using CNN

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with TensorFlow to classify potato leaf images into three categories:
- **Early Blight**
- **Late Blight**
- **Healthy**

It aims to assist farmers and researchers in identifying diseases early using **computer vision techniques**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Accurate image classification** for three types of leaf conditions.
- **End-to-end pipeline**: from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- **Optimized dataset pipeline** using **Cache, Shuffle, and Prefetch** for efficient data loading.
- **Data Augmentation** to improve model generalization and robustness.
- **Visualizations** of training and evaluation results.
- **GPU-powered training** for high performance.
